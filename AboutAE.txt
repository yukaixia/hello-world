I admire Albert Einstein, one of the brightest stars in the scientific domain, the father of modern physics.

The personal trait I admire him the most if his perseverance. At his young age, he took a lot of time to learn speaking and found difficult to articulate, on of his teacher even force him to drop out of school. At the age of 16, he failed entering University of Zurich. But he was not frustrated and did not give up learning. Through hard-working, he finally became the founder of physics.

He has made significant contributions to physics and the world. One of his great inventions is an effect called the “gravitational redshift”. This might sound boring but it is the origin of the GPS system which is commonly used nowadays, for example, it is widely used in Run Tracker applications in our smart phones.

I hope I can learn from his hard-working attitude and become a man as great as him to contribute to the society, to contribute to the world.
